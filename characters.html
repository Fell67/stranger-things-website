          <p class="profile-card__role">Telekinetic girl from Hawkins Lab</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Raised as a test subject in a secret government facility, Eleven escaped into the real world with nothing but her powers and her courage.
            Beneath her quiet, serious exterior is a fiercely loyal girl who would risk everything to protect her friends and the town that finally gave her a family.
            Her connection to the Upside Down makes her both humanity’s greatest weapon and its most haunted survivor.

          <p class="profile-card__role">Loyal leader of the friend group</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Mike is the heart of the Party. He is compassionate, idealistic, and often the first to stand up for what’s right.
            His friendship with Will and Dustin anchors the group, while his love and trust in Eleven give her the strength to face impossible battles.
            Though still learning how to lead, Mike’s bravery and hope often light the way for everyone else.

          <p class="profile-card__role">The boy caught between worlds</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Sensitive, artistic, and kind-hearted, Will’s disappearance into the Upside Down started the nightmare that changed Hawkins forever.
            Though rescued, he still feels echoes of that dark world and carries the emotional scars of being its prisoner.
            Will’s intuition and empathy often reveal truths that others overlook, making him both fragile and quietly powerful.

          <p class="profile-card__role">Skeptical but brave strategist</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            A realist with a soldier’s mindset, Lucas approaches every mystery with logic and caution—until friendship forces him to take leaps of faith.
            Athletic and clever, he’s always the one building slingshots, setting traps, and keeping the group grounded.
            Over time, Lucas learns that true strength isn’t just about defense — it’s about loyalty and heart.

          <p class="profile-card__role">The clever comic relief</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            With boundless curiosity and an endless supply of nerdy enthusiasm, Dustin brings science and humor to every impossible situation.
            He’s the first to build a radio network, discover a baby Demogorgon, or coin a theory about parallel dimensions.
            His optimism and quick wit keep the Party laughing — even when the world is falling apart.

          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Fierce and funny, Max joined the group as the fearless new kid who refused to play by anyone’s rules.
            Under her confidence lies deep pain from her troubled family and the loss of her brother, Billy.
            Her friendship with Eleven and bravery against Vecna prove that Max may not have powers — but she has the strongest will of them all.

          <p class="profile-card__role">Relentless small-town investigator</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Smart, brave, and tired of being underestimated, Nancy refuses to accept the “official story” when things don’t add up in Hawkins.
            She chases leads like a real reporter, even when it puts her in danger, and she’s usually the first teen to connect the disappearances,
            the lab, and the Upside Down. Underneath it all, she’s just trying to protect the people she loves.

          <p class="profile-card__role">Former cool kid, current monster babysitter</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Steve starts as the popular guy with good hair, but his real character shows up when things get scary.
            He grabs a bat, stands between the kids and danger, and somehow becomes their unofficial big brother.
            He’s brave, surprisingly kind, and usually the one driving everyone to the fight — or away from it.

          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Jonathan sees what other people miss — both literally and emotionally.
            After what happened to Will, he became even more protective of his family.
            Steady and introverted, he balances Nancy’s intensity with calm, and he isn’t afraid to go into the dark if it means saving someone.

          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Robin is sharp, hilarious, and constantly thinking ten steps ahead.
            She and Steve become an unexpected duo, translating Russian messages, sneaking into secret bases,
            and doing it all while panicking out loud. She brings levity and brainpower to the teen team.

          <p class="profile-card__role">Gruff sheriff with a soft center</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Hopper starts as the tired small-town cop, but once kids start disappearing, he turns into the kind of dad and protector he never got to be.
            He’ll break into labs, punch government agents, or disappear to another dimension if that’s what it takes.
            His love for Eleven and loyalty to Joyce are what keep him fighting.

          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Everyone thought she was “just being dramatic” when she said her missing son was talking through Christmas lights — but she was right.
            Joyce is intuitive, emotional, and relentless. She doesn’t care if people think she’s crazy; she cares about getting her kids back and shutting down whatever is hurting Hawkins.

          <p class="profile-card__role">The Upside Down’s thinking monster</p>
          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            Unlike the mindless creatures, Vecna picks his victims very carefully. He studies their grief and uses it against them.
            Once known as Henry Creel and then as “One” in Hawkins Lab, he was the first child with powers before Eleven defeated him.
            Now he wants to open permanent gates and bring the Upside Down fully into Hawkins.

          <p class="profile-card__bio">
            The first creature to cross over, the Demogorgon is fast, ruthless, and hunts by movement and sound.
            It’s the monster that took Will, killed lab workers, and showed Hawkins that this wasn’t just a weird science accident —
            something alive was coming through. Even armed adults struggle to kill one.
