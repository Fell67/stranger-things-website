              Deep within the quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana, the Hawkins National Laboratory conducted government-funded
              research that delved far beyond the ordinary. What began as scientific exploration soon touched on the
              extraordinary—experiments involving perception, consciousness, and dimensions unseen by most.
          </p>
          <p>
              Though the lab’s work was meant to stay secret, its discoveries opened doors that were never meant to be opened,
              allowing forces from elsewhere to slip through. The strange phenomena that followed would forever change the lives
              of those who called Hawkins home.
