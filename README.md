## Assignment Details
In this assignment, you will work with a larger codebase and practice organizing CSS in a way that supports collaboration with other developers. This assignment is designed to help you apply everything you've learned about CSS so far in a more complex, real-world context.

### Setup
Groups will be selected by your instructor and consist of 2-3 members per group.

The preferred method of communication between yourself and your classmates will be up to you and your group members.

You should select a leader for your group. The group leader will be responsible for creating and setting up the GitHub repository, as well as reviewing pull requestsLinks to an external site.. The group leader will also have the final say over design and implementation details for your project in the event the group cannot reach a consensus on a particular decision. That said, the group leader should ensure that all group members are encouraged to contribute to the design and development of the project.

The group leader will also be responsible for creating a git repository with a professional-sounding title and adding each group member to the repository as a contributorLinks to an external site..

The group leader will also set up a branch protection rule for the main branchLinks to an external site. and ensure at least one contributor must approve changes before merging the pull request into the main branch.

Each group member will then clone the project repository to his/her computer. When working on the project, each member should create a branch locally for a feature he/she is working on, using git commits as necessary for any completed milestones on the way to implementing the desired feature. Then, the group member should push the changes to GitHub and create a pull request to be reviewed by the other group members before merging to the main branch.

Allowing group members to push changes directly to the main branch is strongly discouraged.

### Instructions
For this project, you and your group will design, code, and deploy a website for or related to a TV show, book series, or sports team. To receive full-credit for this project, your submission must:

Have no less than 3 unique pages.
Have consistent styles throughout all pages of the site.
Be responsive on both tablet and cell-phone sized screens.
Use CSS flexbox at least once.
Use semantic HTML tags where appropriate.
Utilize BEM naming conventions for its CSS rules.
Include at least one usage of CSS transitions.
Include at least one usage of CSS animations.
All group members must make relatively equal coding contributions to the website to receive credit. To help assess those contributions, each individual group member must also complete a group project assessment along with the project links. The assessment should contain:

A description of your contributions
A description of contributions by each other team member
A short reflection (approximately 500 words) on how you feel the project went that includes any lessons learned or challenges that were encountered and overcome in the process.
Deployment
Your group leader must deploy your site to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages:

Ensure your repository has an index.html file in the root directory.
Navigate to the settings section of the repository.
Click on pages in the left navigation menu.
Under source click the dropdown and select your master or main branch.
Click save.
Your site should be deployed to <your leader's github username>.github.io/<your repository name> in 5-10 minutes.
